BANK LOAN REPORT

Overview : The Bank Loan Report is an Excel dashboard project that provides comprehensive insights into loan data across different states in the USA. It utilizes various functions, including summary dashboards, macro implementation for theme changes, pivot table & charts and extensive use of loan-related terminologies. The project showcases key performance indicators, such as total loan applications, funded amount, and average interest rates, while also visualizing loan trends through various charts. The project aims to provide a detailed overview of loan data and facilitate data-driven decision-making in the banking industry.

Description : 
- I am working on an Excel dashboard project with two main dashboards: Summary and Overview, as well as a Details section for comprehensive loan data.
- I am implementing Macros (VBA) to enable theme changes within the project.
- I am using various terminologies in the data to provide a detailed understanding of loan-related information.
- The fields used in the data include Loan ID, Address State, Employee Length, Employee Title, Grade, Sub Grade, Home Ownership, Issue Date, Last Credit Pull Date, Last Payment Date, Loan Status, Next Payment Date, Purpose, Term, Verification Status, Annual Income, DTI (Debt-to-Income Ratio), Instalment, Interest Rate, and Loan Amount.
- The Summary dashboard focuses on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total loan applications, total funded amount, total amount received, average interest rate, and average debt-to-income ratio (DTI). It also distinguishes between good loans and bad loans based on loan status criteria.
- The Overview dashboard utilizes various chart types, including line charts, filled maps, donut charts, bar charts, and tree maps, to visually represent loan-related metrics and trends. These charts provide insights into monthly trends, regional analysis, loan term analysis, employee length analysis, loan purpose breakdown, and home ownership.
